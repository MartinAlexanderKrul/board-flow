# BoardFlow UI Surface Inventory

This inventory documents the app's user-facing Compose surfaces: popup windows, dialogs, modal sheets, cards, menus/dropdowns, banners, list surfaces, and other contained UI elements. It is based on the source under `app/src/main/kotlin/cz/nicolsburg/boardflow/ui`.

Use this as a map when changing layout, motion, state handling, or visual language. Keep new surfaces in the same family unless a feature explicitly needs a new pattern.

These are not custom Compose dialogs, but they open system-owned surfaces:

## Maintenance Notes

- Prefer `AnimatedDialog` for custom app dialogs and `BoardFlowConfirmationDialog` for simple confirm/cancel decisions.
- `AnimatedDialog` provides a drag-handle strip at the top; do not add a redundant X close `IconButton` inside the dialog content.
- Name `AnimatedDialog`-backed composables with a `Dialog` suffix, not `Modal` (the three Sync dialogs were renamed accordingly).
- Prefer `BoardFlowModalBottomSheet` for temporary filter panels.
- Prefer `BoardFlowPickerField` + `BoardFlowPickerSheet` for settings-style single-value pickers; do not add new `ExposedDropdownMenuBox` pickers.
- Prefer `SectionCard` for repeated list/group cards.
- Corner-radius families: use `BoardFlowSurfaceTokens.Shape` (12 dp) for standard cards, `BoardFlowSurfaceTokens.ContentCardShape` (16 dp) for prominent feature content surfaces, `BoardFlowActionTokens.ButtonShape` (16 dp) for buttons, and `BoardFlowConfirmationTokens.Shape` (24 dp) for confirmation dialogs. Do not introduce new hardcoded radius values in the 14–22 dp range.
- Button hierarchy: use `BoardFlowButton` / `BoardFlowPrimaryButton` for primary actions, `BoardFlowSecondaryButton` / `BoardFlowOutlinedButton` for secondary actions, `BoardFlowTonalButton` for compact secondary actions inside cards and dialogs (grey surfaceVariant fill, 42 dp height), `BoardFlowDestructiveButton` for destructive actions. Do not add raw `FilledTonalButton` or `Button` calls without a BoardFlow wrapper.
- Paired action rows: when a dialog needs two sibling actions (e.g. destructive + confirm, or delete + save), place them in a `Row` with `weight(1f)` on each button, icons leading. Use `BoardFlowDestructiveButton` + `BoardFlowButton` for destructive/confirm pairs, `BoardFlowTonalButton` + `BoardFlowTonalButton` for neutral pairs.
- Chip overflow: use `SubcomposeLayout` for row-capped chip lists (e.g. 2-row limit with "Show all" overflow). `FlowRowOverflow.expandOrClip` is not available in Compose BOM 2024.08.00.
- Log Play game search shows owned games only (no wishlist). Use `AppViewModel.logPlaySearchResults` / `loadLogPlayGames()` / `filterLogPlayGames()` — do not switch this screen to the shared `searchResults` flow.
- Text separators: use `" · "` as the standard inline-text separator between metadata items; avoid mixing with `" - "` or em-dashes in the same visual context.
- Avoid adding business logic directly to composables when a surface grows; push state decisions into view models or small UI state models.
- When adding a new surface, update this file with the trigger, file, and dismissal/confirmation behavior.
