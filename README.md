# BoardFlow

BoardFlow is an Android app for tracking board game plays with BoardGameGeek, Google Sheets / Drive, local offline history, roster-aware player stats, sleeve data, and AI-assisted score extraction.

It is built with Jetpack Compose and uses Room as the live local source of truth for collection data, local play history, and cached BGG play history.

## What The App Does

BoardFlow combines several related workflows in one app:

- search your collection or BGG for a game to log
- continue a recent session or use "play again" flows
- log a play directly to BGG when online
- save a play locally when offline
- post saved local plays later from History via an outbox-style "Unposted plays" section
- scan a score sheet photo and extract players / scores with Gemini
- manage a saved player roster with aliases and optional BGG usernames
- review play history, aggregate stats, and saved-player activity
- edit or delete logged plays
- browse your collection, wishlist, and sleeve coverage
- exclude specific games from sleeve sync and display
- share a logged play as a QR code; import a play from a QR code
- sync your collection to a Google Sheet
- create or connect a Google spreadsheet
- import a CSV file into a sheet
- create Drive folders and QR-related assets through the Google sync pipeline
- export and import app data backups
- detect record moments after a play (first win, new high score, win streak)

## Main User Flows

### 1. Log Play

Screens involved:

- `ui/search/NewPlayScreen.kt`
- `ui/scan/ScanScreen.kt`
- `ui/review/LogPlayScreen.kt`

Flow:

1. Pick a game from recent games, local collection search, or BGG search.
2. Optionally continue the last session for the same game or use a "play again" flow from History / Collection.
3. Optionally scan a scoresheet image and let Gemini prefill players and scores.
4. Review and edit the play in the compact card-based Log Play sheet.
5. Post to BGG if online and authenticated, or save locally for later if offline / posting fails.

Notable behavior:

- game search prefers the local loaded collection, then falls back to BGG XML search
- BGG search covers both base games and expansions (`type=boardgame,boardgameexpansion`)
- BGG search results are sorted alphabetically; lists over 20 items show a draggable fast-scroll bar with a floating letter bubble and haptic feedback per section
- search is debounced (300ms); local collection is checked first; if no match, BGG is queried with `exact=1` then `exact=0` as a fallback
- background collection loads never overwrite an active BGG search result set; the guard is cleared when the user selects a game or clears the query
- session context (game, players, location) is persisted across app restarts for up to 4 hours
- log form tracks unsaved changes
- player rows are keyed UI items with shared editing UI between log and edit flows
- matched roster players are explicit; non-exact fuzzy matches require user confirmation
- plays support quantity (multi-game sessions), incomplete flag, and nowInStats toggle
- expansions / sibling titles are detected from name patterns and shown alongside the base game

### 2. Edit Existing Play

Screen involved:

- `ui/history/HistoryScreen.kt` (`EditPlayDialog`)

Behavior:

- opens from History play details
- uses the same compact player editor visual language as Log Play
- preserves fields on configuration changes with saveable state
- stays open when save fails so the user can correct and retry
- updates the local Room record, and updates BGG too when the play is already posted there

### 3. History

Screen involved:

- `ui/history/HistoryScreen.kt`

Tabs:

- `Plays`
- `Stats`
- `Players`

Current behavior:

- local plays and cached BGG plays are merged for display; deduplication uses a signature-based matching strategy to avoid showing the same play twice
- local-only plays can be deleted locally
- BGG-backed plays can be deleted from BGG and pruned from cache
- an `Unposted plays` card in Plays acts as the manual outbox for local plays not yet posted to BGG; supports per-play posting and bulk sync
- stats support date filters and richer insight cards
- players tab is roster-only and sorts by most recent saved-player activity
- history rows always show all logged players and do not collapse same/similar names into one row
- unsaved logged names can still be grouped as `Unknown` in general stats where appropriate
- plays can be shared as QR codes and imported from QR

### 4. Collection

Screen involved:

- `ui/collection/CollectionScreen.kt`
- `ui/collection/GameDetailDialog.kt`

Tabs / areas:

- `Owned`
- `Wishlist`
- `Sleeves`

Behavior:

- collection data comes from the canonical Room snapshot managed by sync
- game detail dialog links collection data with history and player insights
- collection-to-history and collection-to-player deep links are supported
- sleeve data is merged from BGG, scraping, and local exclusions; individual games can be excluded from sleeve display
- the `Owned` tab strictly means owned games

### 5. Sync

Screen involved:

- `ui/sync/SyncScreen.kt`
- `ui/sync/SpreadsheetModal.kt`

Behavior:

- manages readiness for BGG, Google account, and spreadsheet connection
- supports refreshing BGG collection
- supports refreshing sleeve sizes
- supports full Google Sheet sync
- supports creating a spreadsheet from BGG
- supports connecting an existing spreadsheet
- supports CSV import/merge into a sheet
- supports creating Drive folders and uploading / downloading QR codes
- shows a sync log with summary + detailed dialog
- can clear local sync log state
- collection refresh automatically backfills play counts from cached BGG play history when BGG play count is missing

### 6. Settings

Screen involved:

- `ui/settings/SettingsScreen.kt`

Sections:

- `Accounts`
- `Appearance`
- `AI`
- `Data`

Behavior:

- manage BGG username/password
- manage Google account and spreadsheet connection
- set Gemini API key and configurable model endpoint
- discover and select from available Gemini models
- switch app theme (Light, Dark)
- choose priority sleeve manufacturer shown first in sleeve recommendations
- export backup JSON, optionally including sensitive data
- import backup JSON
- clear cached collection data

## Data Model And Storage

### Live Local Source Of Truth

The live runtime store is Room via:

- `data/CanonicalCollectionStore.kt`

It stores:

- canonical merged collection snapshot (`GameItem` records)
- local logged plays
- cached BGG play history

### Preferences / Secrets

`data/SecurePreferences.kt` stores:

- BGG credentials (username, password)
- Gemini configuration (API key, model endpoint, available models cache)
- app theme and sleeve manufacturer priority
- recent games (last 50)
- player roster (display names, aliases, BGG usernames)
- sync-related preferences (spreadsheet ID, sheet tab name, Google email)
- session context (active game, players, location, timestamp)
- sleeve exclusion list (game IDs excluded from sleeve display)
- per-game insight key cache

### Import / Export

`data/BackupSerializer.kt` handles backup JSON import/export (current format version 2).

Backups can include:

- collection snapshot (full `GameItem` array)
- local logged plays
- cached BGG plays
- player roster
- recent games
- sleeve exclusions
- settings (theme, spreadsheet config, sleeve preference)
- optionally sensitive data (BGG password, Gemini API key)

Import is selective: only fields present in the backup JSON are applied; missing fields do not overwrite existing values.

## External Integrations

### BoardGameGeek

Used for:

- collection refresh (authenticated and unauthenticated flows)
- BGG XML game search outside the loaded collection
- play history fetch / refresh
- play logging, editing, and deletion
- sleeve-related metadata inputs

Notes:

- play posting/editing/deletion uses authenticated flows with cookie-based session persistence
- BGG XML search outside the local collection requires `BGG_XML_API_TOKEN`
- when token-backed search is unavailable, the app fails quietly to an empty result state

### Google Identity / Sheets / Drive

Used for:

- account selection
- Drive / Sheets authorization
- spreadsheet creation / connection
- pushing collection data to Sheets (create/update by objectId)
- CSV import/merge
- Drive folder creation per game
- QR code upload/download

### Gemini

Used for:

- AI-assisted score extraction from images

The app supports:

- user-provided Gemini API key
- configurable model endpoint
- model discovery and automatic fallback/cycling when a model is unavailable

## UX / Product Notes

Current app behavior intentionally includes:

- manual user-controlled posting of saved local plays from History instead of silent auto-post on startup
- roster-aware but explicit player matching; fuzzy matches (Levenshtein distance) shown as suggestions, not auto-applied
- preserved local history even when offline
- shared compact player editing UI between log and edit flows
- history navigation from Collection and player-centric screens
- stats and players views that are based on saved roster entities where appropriate
- record moment detection (first win, new high score, win streak) surfaced immediately after logging
- expansion/sibling title grouping driven by name pattern heuristics

## Build

From repo root:

```sh
./gradlew.bat :app:compileDebugKotlin
./gradlew.bat :app:assembleDebug
```

Debug APK output:

```text
app/build/outputs/apk/debug/board-flow-debug.apk
```

Install on a connected device/emulator:

```sh
./gradlew.bat :app:installDebug
```

## Configuration

### Required / common app settings

Set in Settings as needed:

- BGG username
- BGG password
- Gemini API key
- Gemini model endpoint

Google sign-in / Sheets / Drive also require valid Firebase / Google Cloud OAuth setup:

- `google-services.json`
- Android + Web OAuth clients
- correct SHA fingerprints for debug/release

Compile success does not guarantee runtime Google auth success if that external setup is wrong.

## Verification

Recommended local verification after meaningful changes:

```sh
./gradlew.bat :app:compileDebugKotlin
```

Use this too when startup/resources/packaging changed:

```sh
./gradlew.bat :app:assembleDebug
```

## Text Encoding

- keep source and docs in UTF-8
- be careful with PowerShell bulk rewrites
- prefer plain ASCII punctuation where practical
- if you see mojibake like `Ã‚Â·` or `Ã¢â‚¬Â¦`, fix it before committing
